# triangle
This is my project where I wrote a c++ code identifying whether three coordinates could form a triangle or not. 

Ways to determine:<br />
1: Using the property of triangle: the sum of two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side + Heron Formula<br />
2: Using Determinant<br />
3: Using Determinant and simplified it<br />

In addition, in .1 versions, I also included identifying whether the triangle contains the origin or not using the property of triangle: <br />
When a point inside(on the edge) a triangle is connected to the three vertecis, the sum of the area of the three triangles formed would be equivalent to the area of the triangle
